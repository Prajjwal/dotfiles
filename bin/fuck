# Proc fucker upper.
# Infinitely more satisfying kill -9.
# Got the idea here: https://twitter.com/louroboros/status/412913768998268928

# Requirements:
# Expects toilet to be installed.

# USAGE:
# Make this script executable & stick it somewhere in your $PATH. Then:
#
# fuck you <process>

# TODO:
# Add support for signals other than KILL

if killall -9 "$2"; then
	echo
	echo "(╯°□°）╯︵$(echo "$2" | toilet -f term -F rotate)"
	echo
fi
