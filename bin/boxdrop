# Share a file publicly on Dropbox.

# Requirements:
#
# Expects Dropbox to be installed and syncing ~/Dropbox.
#
# Expects xclip to be installed.
#
# Uses a variable called $puburl to generate url, if set. This is a
# url like https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/<uid>. You can figure out
# yours by generating a public link for a file in your Dropbox/public folder.
# This is faster and more reliable than requesting the dropbox daemon for a url.
# It doesn't always respond.

# Usage:
# boxdrop <filename> <destination_filename>
#
# <destination_filename> is optional. Only use it if you want to set a different
# name for the public file.
